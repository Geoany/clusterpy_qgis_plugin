<h2>Research in Spatial Economics</h2>
<p>In our group we develop quantitative methods for spatial analysis that allow
researchers, public and private institutions to attain a better understanding of
their georeferenced data. Our methodologies are characterized by their
multidisciplinarity, involving research domains such as operation research,
econometrics and exploratory spatial data analysis.</p>
